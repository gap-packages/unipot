# The Unipot package

The `Unipot` package provides GAP with the ability to compute with
elements of unipotent subgroups of Chevalley groups, but also some
properties of this groups.


## Installing UNIPOT

This document describes the procedure of installing the package.

Installing `Unipot` should be easy once you have installed GAP itself.
We assume here that you want to install `Unipot` in its standard
location, which is in the `pkg` subdirectory of the main GAP4
installation.

You have to perform the following steps to install `Unipot`:

- Get the sources.
- Unpack the sources into the `pkg` directory.

You can download the sources from
 <https://gap-packages.github.io/unipot/>

If you installed a complete copy of the standard GAP
distribution, then `Unipot` is most likely already installed. If not,
you can download the package `Unipot` separately. In that case go to the
subdirectory `pkg` of the main GAP directory (when you installed the GAP
distribution, a new directory called `gap-4.<X>` for some <X> was
created; this directory contains the `pkg` subdirectory).
Then extract the sources of the `Unipot` package in there.

## Loading `Unipot` in GAP

The documentation of the package is available in any GAP4 session, even
if the package is not loaded. Like any other package, `Unipot` is loaded
in GAP with

    gap> LoadPackage("unipot");

within the GAP4 session.

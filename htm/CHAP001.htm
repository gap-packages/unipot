<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">Unipot</font> is a package for <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>4 <a href="biblio.htm#GAP4"><cite>GAP4</cite></a>. The  version 1.0
of   this  package  was   the  content  of  my  diploma   thesis
<a href="biblio.htm#SH2000"><cite>SH2000</cite></a>.
<p>
Let <i>U</i> be a unipotent  subgroup of  a  Chevalley  group of Type
<i>L</i>(<i>K</i>).  Then it is generated by  the  elements <i>x</i><sub><i>r</i></sub>(<i>t</i>) for all
<i>r</i> &#8712; &#934;<sup>+</sup>,<i>t</i> &#8712; <i>K</i>. The roots of the underlying  root  system
&#934;  are  ordered  according  to  the height  function.  Each
element of  <i>U</i> is  a product of the  root elements <i>x</i><sub><i>r</i></sub>(<i>t</i>). By
Theorem 5.3.3 from  <a href="biblio.htm#Carter72"><cite>Carter72</cite></a>  each element of <i>U</i> can  be
uniquely  written  as a product  of root  elements with roots in
increasing order. This unique form is called the canonical form.
<p>
The main  purpose  of this  package is to compute the  canonical
form of an element of the group <i>U</i>. For we have implemented the
unipotent subgroups  of Chevalley groups and  their elements  as
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> objects and  installed  some  operations  for  them.  One
method for the operation <code>Comm</code>  uses the Chevalley's commutator
formula, which we have implemented, too.

<h2><a name="SECT001">1.1 Root Systems</a></h2>
<p><p>
We  are  using  the  root  systems and  the  structure constants
available in <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> from  the simple  Lie algebras. We  also are
using the same ordering of roots available in <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>.

<h2><a name="SECT002">1.2 Citing Unipot</a></h2>
<p><p>
If you  use <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">Unipot</font> to solve a problem or publish some  result
that was partly obtained  using <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">Unipot</font>, I would appreciate it
if you would  cite <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">Unipot</font>,  just  as you  would  cite another
paper that you used. (Below is a sample citation.) Again I would
appreciate if you could inform me about such a paper.
